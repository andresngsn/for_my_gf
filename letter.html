            <p>Dear Karylle, </p> <br>
            
            <p>I know we started this year off rough.
             I am sorry for that.  <br>
            I promise I will try to be better, for you and for myself. <br>
            Even then, you tried to be good to me. 
            You are so amazing. <br>
            I don't tell you that enough...or at all. I am so in love with you.<br> 
            I think that you are so beautiful inside and out. <br>
            Despite everything you've been through, you still have enough kindness to give to everybody else.
            Never change that heart of yours. <br>
            </p>
            <p>I love you always,</p>
